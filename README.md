#### Project Description ####

The web app is basically designed for users who want to research about an apartment building before they move into it. You have apps like Streeteasy (https://streeteasy.com/) in order to look for places for rent. This app will provide reviews from previous or current tenants about that apartment building. Think of it as Glassdoor but for apartment buildings. 

All users will retain their anonimity.

#### Author's Notes ####

This is pretty much a mock-up to practice jQuery, CSS, and HTML. It is also a way for me to solidify my knowledge on web design principles such as colors, typography, and whitespace.
